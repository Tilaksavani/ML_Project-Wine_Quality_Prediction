# ML_Project-üç∑Wine_Quality_Predictionüçæ

### Project Overview

This project delves into the fascinating realm of wine quality prediction using machine learning. It leverages a Random Forest classifier, known for its robustness and ability to handle complex data, to uncover patterns in a dataset of chemical and physical properties associated with wine quality.

###  Data

Publicly available datasets like kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository's "Wine" dataset are commonly used. These datasets contain attributes like:
Fixed acidity (g/l), Volatile acidity (g/l), Citric acid (g/l), Residual sugar (g/l), Chlorides (g/l), Free sulfur dioxide (mg/l), Total sulfur dioxide (mg/l), Density (g/cm3), pH, Sulphates (g/l), Alcohol (%), Wine quality (integer score)

###  Random Forest Classifier for Wine Quality Prediction

Random Forest Classifier is a well-suited model for this task as it excels in multiclass classification problems like predicting the quality of the wine. The model analyzes the wine data and calculates the probability of wine quality based on the provided features.

###  Running the Project

The main script (`main.py` or similar) typically follows these steps:

1. **Load the data:** Load the wine quality dataset using appropriate libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and potentially encoding categorical features (if present).
3. **Split Data:** Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, and the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
4. **Model Training:** Train the logistic regression model on the training data. 
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
6. **(Optional) Model Saving:**  Save the trained model for future use.
